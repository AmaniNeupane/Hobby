        <p class="para">My hobby is reading 
fascinating and mysterious books in my free time. Whenever I come home from school I like to read (after completing my homework). I am 10 years old and I am (almost) in grade 5. My parents tell me that reading is a SPECTACULAR hobby because not only am I having fun, I am learning something too. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Reading is a fantastic source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us feel happy and relaxed. Honestly, if you don't like reading, you are not a human.
